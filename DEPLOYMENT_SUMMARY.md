# üéâ Fresh Deployment Complete!

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Contract Deployment
- **Cleaned** previous deployments with `npx hardhat clean`
- **Compiled** contracts successfully
- **Deployed** fresh contracts to Sepolia testnet

### 2. New Contract Addresses
- **PostContract**: `0xde7D700547aAE7467ccCbAEd614310601fd7ca1C`
- **SocialContract**: `0x338dDFcBf71B5327b955b3780161e04fB85D0787`
- **ProfileContract**: `0x039Bc06F795a78f823c59863A844b41886dEe7F3`

### 3. Frontend Configuration Updated
- Updated `frontend/src/config/contracts.js` with new addresses
- Added `PROFILE_CONTRACT_ABI` to contracts config
- Updated `frontend/src/services/profileService.js` to use new ProfileContract address
- Updated `deployment-info.json` with deployment details

### 4. Profile Issue Resolved
**Why profiles were still showing after clearing Firebase/Pinata:**
- The profile service was using an old ProfileContract address: `0x08A915445A77Fe63aD1c57a8A6034F3159A7fcD2`
- This old contract still had profile data from previous deployments
- Now using fresh ProfileContract: `0x039Bc06F795a78f823c59863A844b41886dEe7F3`
- All profile data will now be fresh and empty!

### 5. Verification Complete
- ‚úÖ All three contracts deployed and verified on Sepolia
- ‚úÖ Basic functions tested (post count, social features, profile functions)
- ‚úÖ Frontend configuration validated
- ‚úÖ No syntax or compilation errors

## üîç Answer to Your Question

**"How are profiles still being fetched after clearing Firebase and Pinata?"**

The profiles were being fetched from the old ProfileContract at address `0x08A915445A77Fe63aD1c57a8A6034F3159A7fcD2`. Even though you cleared Firebase and Pinata, the blockchain data in that old contract remained. 

Now with the fresh ProfileContract deployment at `0x039Bc06F795a78f823c59863A844b41886dEe7F3`, all profile data is completely fresh and empty. No old profiles will show up anymore!
