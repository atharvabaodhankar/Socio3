## Project: Socio3 ‚Äì A Web3-Powered Social Media dApp  

### üß© Overview
**Socio3** is a decentralized social media platform inspired by Instagram ‚Äî reimagined for Web3.  
It allows users to share posts, follow creators, tip in crypto, and truly **own** their digital content through blockchain-powered storage and smart contracts.

Socio3 merges the familiar feel of social networks with the transparency, security, and ownership benefits of decentralization.

## üß± 1. System Architecture

### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** React (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Web3 Library:** Ethers.js
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask / WalletConnect
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Hosting:** Vercel or Firebase Hosting

### **Backend / Off-chain**
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (real-time comments, notifications, and temporary caching)
- **Storage:** IPFS via Pinata or Web3.Storage (for media uploads)
- **Authentication:** Wallet-based login (no passwords, no email)
- **Functions:** Firebase Cloud Functions for triggering notifications and post updates

### **Blockchain Layer**
- **Smart Contract Framework:** Hardhat
- **Language:** Solidity
- **Network:** Sepolia Testnet
- **Core Contracts:**
  1. `PostContract.sol` ‚Üí stores post metadata (author, IPFS CID, timestamp)
  2. `SocialContract.sol` ‚Üí handles follows, likes, tips, and ownership logic
- **Interaction:** via Ethers.js in React frontend

---

## üé® 2. UI/UX Design

### **Design Principles**
- Minimal, responsive, and visually similar to Instagram‚Äôs clean aesthetic.  
- Dark-first interface with smooth transitions and gradients.  
- Framer Motion for micro-interactions (like button animations, modals).  
- Emphasis on wallet-based identity and decentralization transparency.  

---

## üß≠ 3. User Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - User connects via MetaMask or WalletConnect.
   - On first login, Socio3 creates a wallet-linked profile in Firestore.

2. **Create Post**
   - User uploads an image/video (stored on IPFS).
   - Adds caption, hashtags ‚Üí stored in Firestore.
   - The IPFS hash and wallet address are written to the blockchain.

3. **View Feed**
   - Posts are fetched from Firestore (metadata verified via blockchain).
   - Feed is ordered by time, likes, or tips.
   - Users can interact with posts in real-time.

4. **Interactions**
   - Like/Unlike ‚Üí handled through SocialContract.
   - Comments ‚Üí stored in Firestore (for speed).
   - Tip ‚Üí sends ETH directly to creator via Ethers.js.

5. **Profile**
   - Displays wallet-based username, posts, tips earned, and follower count.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Smart Contract Design

### **PostContract.sol**
Handles creation and retrieval of posts.

```solidity
struct Post {
    address author;
    string ipfsHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
````

Functions:

* `createPost(string memory ipfsHash)`
* `getPost(uint256 id)`
* `getAllPosts()`

### **SocialContract.sol**

Manages likes, follows, and tips.

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public following;
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public tips;
```

Functions:

* `followUser(address user)`
* `likePost(uint256 postId)`
* `tipPost(uint256 postId) payable`

## üîê 8. Security Considerations

* Verify wallet signatures for sensitive operations.
* Validate and sanitize captions before uploading.
* Use contract modifiers for access control (e.g., only author can delete post).
* Pin all IPFS uploads for permanence.
* Rate-limit posting via Firebase functions to prevent spam.
