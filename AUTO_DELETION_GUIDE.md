# üõ°Ô∏è Auto-Deletion System Guide

## Overview
Socio3 uses an intelligent auto-deletion system to maintain content quality and community safety. Posts are automatically removed based on community reports and engagement metrics.

## üéØ Deletion Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Report Threshold
**Condition:** `reports >= 5`  
**Action:** Immediate removal  
**Reason:** "Automatically removed: Exceeded report threshold"

**Examples:**
- 5 reports + 0 likes = ‚ùå REMOVED
- 5 reports + 10 likes = ‚ùå REMOVED  
- 5 reports + 100 likes = ‚ùå REMOVED

### Scenario 2: Low Engagement + Multiple Reports
**Condition:** `likes == 0 && reports >= 3`  
**Action:** Faster removal for unpopular content  
**Reason:** "Automatically removed: Multiple reports on low-engagement content"

**Examples:**
- 0 likes + 3 reports = ‚ùå REMOVED
- 0 likes + 2 reports = ‚úÖ SAFE
- 1 like + 3 reports = ‚úÖ SAFE (doesn't meet condition)

### Scenario 3: Report-to-Like Ratio (Future Implementation)
**Condition:** `reports >= (likes √ó 2)`  
**Action:** Removal when reports significantly exceed engagement  
**Reason:** "Automatically removed: High report-to-like ratio"

**Examples:**
- 1 like + 2 reports = ‚ùå REMOVED
- 2 likes + 4 reports = ‚ùå REMOVED
- 5 likes + 10 reports = ‚ùå REMOVED
- 10 likes + 15 reports = ‚úÖ SAFE (15 < 20)

## üìä Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Currently Active
- **High Report Threshold** (5+ reports)
- **Low Engagement Filter** (0 likes + 3+ reports)
- **Duplicate Report Prevention** (one report per user per post)
- **Blockchain Logging** (all actions recorded)

### üîÑ In Development
- **Report-to-Like Ratio** (requires SocialContract integration)
- **Appeal System** (for wrongly removed posts)
- **Graduated Penalties** (warnings before removal)
- **Community Voting** (let users vote on borderline cases)

## üîî User Notifications

When a post is removed, the author receives:

### Notification Content
```
üìß Subject: Your post has been removed from Socio3

Dear Creator,

```

### Notification Delivery
- üì± **In-App Notification** (when user visits the platform)
- üîî **Browser Notification** (if enabled)
- üìß **Email** (future feature)

## üõ†Ô∏è Admin Controls

### Manual Override
Admins can manually remove posts using:
```solidity
manuallyRemovePost(uint256 _postId, string _reason)
```

### Threshold Adjustment
Admins can adjust the report threshold:
```solidity
setReportThreshold(uint256 _threshold) // Default: 5
```

### View Removed Posts
Admins can see all removed posts:
```solidity
getRemovedPosts() // Returns array of removed posts
```

## üéÆ Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: High Reports
1. Create a test post
2. Get 5 different accounts to report it
3. Post should be automatically removed
4. Author should receive notification

### Test Scenario 2: Low Engagement
1. Create a post that gets no likes
2. Get 3 accounts to report it
3. Post should be removed faster than high-engagement posts

### Test Scenario 3: Popular Content
1. Create a post that gets many likes
2. Get some reports (less than threshold)
3. Post should remain visible due to positive engagement

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring
